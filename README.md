[00:00.69] Now I face out, I hold out
[00:03.77] I reach out to the truth of my life
[00:06.99] Seeking to seize on the whole moment, yeah
[00:20.94] Yeah, naked truth lies, only if you realize
[00:24.00] Appearing in nobody's eyes, till they sterilize
[00:26.71] Stop the guerrilla, warfare to keep it fair
[00:29.49] Bro, change your rage to a smarter greater cause
[00:32.51] You know the stake is high stardom is near
[00:35.32] Those who sympathized you died, killer pass you by
[00:38.20] Do not waste your time In hating flirting guys
[00:40.93] Use your might to AIs to do justice to them all
[00:43.15] I face out, I hold out
[00:46.10] I reach out to the truth of my life
[00:49.22] Seeking to seize on the whole moment to
[00:51.92] Now break away
[00:54.65] Oh God let me out, can you let me out?
[00:57.42] Can you set me free from this dark inner world
[01:01.16] Save me now, last beat in the soul
